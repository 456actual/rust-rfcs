# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Add a limited, principled, form of the `goto` statement and labels.
Certain control flows, while expressible are exponentially more verbose without it.
Adding `goto` should also satisfy most use-cases for guaranteed constant-space tail calls.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Syntax

First an example:

```rust
{
    goto foo(a);

    label 'foo(a: i32) {
        goto 'bar(a)
    }

    label 'bar(a: i32) {
        return a;
    }
}
```

I've prototyped the precise grammar changes at https://github.com/Ericson2314/rustypop/tree/goto.
The most important idea is that any block can now contain statements (at least one) followed be these "label blocks" (also at least one).
Note there can be no final expression in this case.
Label blocks themselves generally mirror functions.
They differ in that
 - they start with `label` instead of `fn`
 - their names are prefixed "'".
 - cannot have type parameters
 - cannot have a explicit return type, because they represent continuations

`goto '<label>(<arguments>)` is a new expression form.
Just like with function and function calls, the parenthesis are mandatory:
`label bar() { .. }` is a label block with zero parameters, and `goto bar()` is the goto expression with zero arguments.

Every label name is in scope everywhere in the block contain the binding label block.
For forwards-compatability with later extensions however, no two labels in a function can share the same even if they are not in the same scope.

## Type rules

 - `goto` expressions, like their `break` and `return` cousins, always has type `!`.

 - label blocks' bodies also always have type `!`.

 - `return` expressions in label blocks break out of the enclosing function, and thus do not interact with the type of the label block.

## The rest of the Semantics

One can only `goto` a label block in scope (defined in an enclosing block).
Actually, as the MIR only has function-local variables, this rule isn't really necessary.
But relaxing this restriction probably just puts needless cognitive burden on users.
We can always relax it in the future.



there shouldn't be too many issues desugaring this.
   However it's harder to reason about, and isn't strictly necessary to achieve the goal of less function blowup


# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

 - As `goto` subsumes all other control foo constructs, it could cause confusion on what's the best approach.

 - It's useless to put labal blocks in non-body blocks...unless we can break out of arbitrary blocks.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

 - Lighter syntax, e.g. no curly braces or `label`.

 - Allow `goto` to label block not defined in enclosing block.

 - "Expression destinations". a label is in fact an expression, so one can write code like
   ```
   goto foo(1); bar(labal foo)`
   ```
   which would be equivalent to
   ```
   bar(1)`
   ```
   Neat, but confusing and probably not very useful.
   I think this is the wrong way to "functionalize" goto.

 - How do goto label names overlap with loop label names?
