# Summary

Currently, Cargo doesn't know what parts of the standard library packages depend on.
By giving it this knowledge, we can make cross compilation and exotic platform development easier, simplify rustbuild, and allow anyone to easily specify bounds on the standard library for their packages.
This will allow building parts of the standard library from source, but in order to not disrupt existing workflows, the binaries that come with rustc will still be used by default.


# Motivation

First, some background.
`rustc` can be given crates and their location with `--extern <name>=<path>`.
When finding a library, `rustc` first sees if its location has been specified with `--extern`, then looks in any directories specified with `-L`, and finally looks in the "sysroot" [specifically `<sysroot>/lib/rustlib/<target>/lib`].
Cargo passes in all dependencies it builds with `--extern`.
However Cargo does not know about the standard library, so builds of it are taken from the sysroot.

For cross-compiling, one can often download standard library binaries with rustup.
This is convenient, but one cannot expect pre-built binaries for all platforms.
In particular, embedded systems often have detailed configurations to convey as much information as possible about the hardware to the compiler.
Furthermore, not all of the stdlib is available on every platform---there is an RFC in the works to pre-build a smaller set of crates for [Cortex-M microcontrollers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1645).
It would be nice to know if the available subset is adequate before attempting a build.
We can only do that if all packages have explicit standard library deps to cross-reference with platform requirements of each standard library crate.

Now rustup could be augmented to build stdlib binaries in addition to downloading them, but we have extra configuration options for the standard library such as [panic strategies](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1513-less-unwinding.md) along with plans to add more such as [`core` without floats](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1364).
One could also cobble together a way to to tell rustup such configuration options, but we'd like to make sure that all dependencies agree with the plan before trying to execute it.
For panicking, packages can already set a `profile.dev.panic` option to require a specific strategy, and for float support we should add a (default opt-in) feature to core.
Then, if packages can explicitly depend on core they can also specify whether the float feature is needed.
Cargo would be able to infer both of these options by inspecting all crates in the dependency graph.

Rustbuild must currently perform multiple `cargo builds`, the first to build the standard library and the rest to build things which depend on the standard library.
If rustc, rustfmt, etc, and their deps (some of which come from crates.io, and thus aren't specially tailored for building rust) declare deps on std, rustbuild wouldn't need multiple lockfiles.
Keeping multiple in sync is nuisance, and this gets us one step closer to a single `cargo build` building rustc.

The use-cases so far mainly benefit niche corners of the Rust community, but the last should be useful for just about everyone.
Now that multiple versions of Rust have been released, it can be useful to specify the minimum version.
If and when Rust 2, a version with breaking changes, comes out, this will be all the more important.
We don't yet have a plan yet to track the language itself, but by tracking standard library dependencies we make it trivial to specify version requirements like any other package.


# Detailed design

The subsections with "interface" in their title form the normitive part of this RFC.
The rest of this section just illustrate hows they would likely be implemented.

## `Cargo.toml` Interface

First and foremost, one will now be able to depend on standard library crates by version, e.g. `std = "1.10"`.
This will work just as if `std` was on crates.io---features and other modifiers are supported.

For backwards compatibility, Cargo must inject such standard library dependencies for existing packages.
These injected standard library dependencies are called "implicit dependencies" because the user does not specify them explicitly.
Exactly which dependencies will be enjected is unresolved, but a requirement at least as strong as `std = "^1.0"` as a primary and build dependency is assured.
We also have to account for `core` somehow, as it is now stable so packages using it implicitly too cannot be broken.
Other dependencies of `std` besides core we don't need to worry about, because they are only transitive dependencies through `std`, not direct dependencies.

Now, not all crates depend on `std`, or whatever the implicit dependencies are decided to be, so there must be a way to opt out.
For this, we introduce a new `implicit-dependencies` key.
It is defined by default as:
```toml
implicit-dependencies = ["primary", "build", "dev"]
```
This indicates each of `dependencies`, `build-dependencies`, and `dev-dependencies` maps (respectively) is augmented with implicit elements.
A manual definition may be that or almost any subset, in which case only the included dependency maps are augmented.
The one additional rule is `"dev"` must be included in the set: we have no plan for Cargoizing the default test runner (either the attribute syntax manipulation or runtime), and wish to be forward-compatible with doing so in the future.

Finally, if an (explicit) dependency conflicts with one of the implicit defaults, that category of implicit dependency will be skipped.
For example, if a crate explicit depends on `std` as a build-dependency, neither `std` nor any other implicit build dependency will be injected.

## Cargo Command Line Interface

A flag will be added
```
--resolve-compiler-specific=bin,src
```
where either `bin` or `src` may be included in the set.
If `bin` is included, Cargo will allow the use of sysroot binaries to satisfy deps.
It is assumed that the version of all sysroot rlibs is the same as the version of Rust which the compiler implements.
If `src` is included, Cargo will fallback on a compiler-provided package registry when other registries (e.g. crates.io) fail to provide a package.
For backwards compatibility, the default is `--resolve-compiler-specific=bin`.

## Compiler source packaging

While the standard library *interface* defined with each rustc version, the implementation, by virtue of using unstable features, is compiler-specific.
This makes the standard library unfit for crates.io.
(Additionally, the issue of dealing with nightly also makes crates.io hard to use, but that is a less clear-cut obstacle.)

Cargo will soon gain the ability to create and chain custom registries, as described in
https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/2361 .
Compiler's should package the source of their implementation of the standard library as a registry, which can be distributed with the compiler.
In practice, rustc will optionally contain the source in its sysroot.
Rustup may be able to put it there if the default download does not contain it already.

## Cargo implementation

The one thing this RFC requires of the upcoming registry implementation is the ability to chain registries providing defaults and fallbacks when a registry is not manually specified.
By default, crates.io is used, but somebody may wish to prohibit that, or have Cargo first check a repository of local forks before falling back on crates.io.
This overlaps with `[[replace]]` a bit awkwardly, but is generally useful when the exact set of overrides is subject to change out of band with the current project:
the project's `Cargo.toml` would specify something like `default-registry = [ "local-forks", "crates-io" ]`, along with the defintion of "local-forks".

This mechanism is used here used so standard library crates not on crates.io (or whatever the users' `default-registry` fallback chains happens to be) are instead provided by the compiler.
We need to avoid forcing users' packages to enumerate the contents of the compiler registry because exactly what packages the compiler provides changes from one version of Rust to the next.
For example, if a portable `collections` is written for example, Cargo should use that rather than the compiler's own package.
This allows transparently making the standard library less-compiler spefific.

The injection of implicit dependencies is completely defined by the rules described in the first subsection, so this subsection will focus on the meaning of the `--resolve-compiler-specific=` flag.

If `src` is included in the set passed with that flag, Cargo appends a local registry with path `${$CARGO_RUSTC --print sysroot}/src` to the back of the default chain.
In other words, if a package is in none of the user-specified registries contain a package, Cargo will look in the registry provided by the compiler.

If `bin` is included in the set passed with that flag (or inferred from the default), Cargo will build a mock registry by examining the contents of the sysroot.
Any binary in there will be added to the mock registry, with a version deduced the best Cargo can (e.g. from the version of the compiler).
Cargo likewise will have to be conservative with other metadata, e.g. both aborting if any feature is requested of a dep that is resolved to this mock registry, and also aborting if `default-features = false` is specified in such a dep.
The mock registry will have dead last priority in the default chain, even behind the source registry.
The "building" of such a package in the mock registry will consist of copying the binary into the target directory.

[System packages would like to build Rust libraries 1 per system packages, and for this Cargo will need to gain some understanding of prebuilt binaries.
It is hoped that when it does, the mock registry can be removed and the use of sysroot binaries will be less of a one-off hack.]

Since Cargo will copy any binaries it needs from the sysroot when packages from the mock registry are part of the build plan, it would be nice to always prevent rustc from looking in the sysroot when compiling on Cargo's behalf.
This would prevent users using the sysroot from forgetting to specify any non-default standard library dependencies.
A `--no-resolve-sysroot` flag could be added for this purpose, but this is not necessary.

## Rustbuild improvements

When building rust, binaries or source associated with the previous stage are never used, so rustbuild will always pass `--resolve-compiler-specific=` (i.e. that flag with the empty set).

In order to allow building packages that aren't specifically tailored for building rust itself (e.g. they might come from crates.io), Cargo needs to be taught to resolve standard library packages with the current workspace. Either `[[replace]]` can be used for this, or perhaps the members of the workspace would themselves act as a registry.

All binaries for a specific phase can be built with a single `cargo build` (barring special requirements for individual libraries).
Rather than have a multitude of build artifact directories per stage, only one is needed.
After the last compiler is build, an additional mini-stage of building just the standard library could be performed, but distributions wishing to build all deps from source in a standardized fashion (e.g. NixOS) would probably forgo this.


# Drawbacks

 - The mock registry for sysroot binaries is a disgusting hack.

 - Only some crates in the rust repo (at least `core`, `alloc` and `collections`) can properly be built just based upon their `Cargo.toml`.
   However it's precisely only these "foundational" crates that will be of interest to freestanding developers.
   Hosted developers can likely get pre-built binaries for the platform they need with `rustup`, just as they do today.

 - No means of compiling `compiler-rt` is proposed.
   But just as freestanding developers need to provide `rlibc` or similar to successfully link, I think that for the time-being they deal with this themselves.
   This is no step backwards.

 - Compilers could provided crates in their sysroot that don't match the Rust specification, and Cargo would be none the wiser.
   [Technically, this probablem already exists with falling back on the sysroot binaries, but users will probably expect better when they can specify standard library dependencies explicitly.]
   Since the *interface* of the stdlib is specified, it would be neet if we could but a big crate type/interfacex on crates.io, which compiler implementations would need to match.


# Alternatives

 - Instead of copying binaries from the sysroot, we could just leave rustc to find them.
   But then a simple `--no-resolve-sysroot` would not work, and the logic for passing `--extern` would need be more complicated.

 - Previous versions of this RFC were a simpler but more brittle.
   Please refer to the git history to see them.


# Unresolved questions

 - Users of the stable compiler should be able to build the stdlib from source, since it is trusted, but cannot because it uses unstable features.
   Some notion of a trusted package/registry or way to route the secret bootstrap key would be required to fix this.

 - It is unclear how `core` should be an implicit dependency.
   `core = "^1.0"` might work but is a little weird as that core 1.0 is not stabalized.
   This relies on users to not `extern crate core;` if they don't use it, to get around the stability warning on older versions of rust, which is rather sketchy.

 - It is unclear what should go in the lockfile when building with sysroot binaries.

 - Whether to add the `--no-resolve-sysroot` flag to rustc, as described above.

 - Should `cargo new` specify `std`, or any other stdlib crates explicitly by default?
   I'd hope so!
