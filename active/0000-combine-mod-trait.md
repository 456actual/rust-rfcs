# Summary

Traits/type classes and ML both have their advantages, but it is possible to have the best of both
worlds. This is a proposal to extend rust modules to be as powerful as their ML cousins, and as
convenient as traits, subsuming rust mods and traits.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar
with the language to understand, and for somebody familiar with the compiler to implement.
This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

What parts of the design are still TBD?
